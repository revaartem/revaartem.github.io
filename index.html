        <h2>Short about</h2>
        <p>I was always passionate about programming, and when I found Python, I immediately paid attention to it. Python is an interesting programming language that is very flexible and can be used to solve many problems. This flexibility makes it an ideal language for the development of complex applications.<br>
            <br>
        My strong moments are responsibility, willingness to study, perseverance and the ability to work in a team. I take responsibility for my actions and is always ready to study new things to improve my skills. Finally, I understand the importance of cooperation, and I can work well with others in the team.<br>
            <br>
        My goals are to work on an interesting project with a team of professionals, to develop my skills and ultimately become the project manager. With this role, I believe that I can make a great contribution to the success of the project using my experience in programming and solving problems.<br>
            <br>
        Thank you for finding the time to consider my application. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need additional information or if you want to discuss how I can contribute to the success of your organization.<br>
